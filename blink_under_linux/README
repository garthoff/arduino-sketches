The delay function doesn't seem to work correctly under linux.
This causes the blink example to malfunction.

People smarter than me have addressed this issue here:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arduino#delay.28.29_function_doesn.27t_work
and have provided to solutions (there might be others too).

This sketch allows delay to work when compiling under linux.
